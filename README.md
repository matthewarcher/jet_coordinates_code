# jet_coordinates_code

*** Code not polished for general use ***

Matlab code to convert a 2D velocity field of a meandering jet from geographical (lon/lat) to jet (cross-stream/alongstream) coordinates.
Developed by Matt Archer to work with high frequency (HF) radar data in 3D (x,y,t).
Currently being transitioned to work with any generic 2 D data set (e.g. from model, satellite, etc.)
